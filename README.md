# Trigger-Analysis
The codebase contains every script and utility used for trigger analysis, data cleaning, plotting, and report generation. The centerpiece is the timing-resolution workflow, which loads ROOT histograms, applies optional cuts and outlier handling, fits peak regions, and reports timing resolution metrics with uncertainties for each scintillator pair and configuration.
